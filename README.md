# Social Network API
  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

The application acts as a back end for a hypothetical social network where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The app uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM and momentjs to format the timestamp variables. I used Insomnia for testing and validating results of the social media API. This app was written completely in JavaScript and powered by Node.js, Express.js and Mongoose.

## Installation

To install this application, you will need to clone the repo and run a few commands into the terminal. 

**Installs include**:

* ``npm init`` followed by ``npm install`` (These commands will install the dependencies needed for the package.json)

* ``npm install express`` (The webserver framework for Node.js)

* ``npm install mongoose`` (Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more.)

* ``npm install dotenv`` (This package is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. This will help keep your sensitive info [ie passwords] hidden from open source platforms.)

## Usage

The application runs via the root directory by typing ``node index.js`` into your terminal, followed by ``mongod`` in a 2nd terminal.

To test out the CRUD API routes, I used Insomnia.
